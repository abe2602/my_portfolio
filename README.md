This repository contains my Website implementation, I'm using Flutter Web (it's not stable yet), 
so bugs may occur. I tryed to make it as responsible as I could, but if you find any bugs, please

In this project, I'm using Provider do Dependency Injection, and a custom app bar (which doesn't lose it's state).
To acquire this behavior, there's one Navigator to each tab, so when it changes, there's no loss on state.
